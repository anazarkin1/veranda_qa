        - significant UI 
        - interesting back end algorthms

Feedback:
- In signup page, it would be great to indicate whether *Instructor* or *Student* is selected by using a groups of radio buttons or `select`
- The signup page seems buggy to me: "Email already exists." keeps showing up :(
- In dashboard page, the `Created by:` function seems broken.
- The `login` botton keeps showing up even if the user is already logged in.
- When submitting a course creation request, the server sends back status code of 400.
- I would say navigation is not convient.
- It would be nice to have some mechanism to log errors on both the server side and the client side
