# An Open Course Discussion Platform


Our platform [NAME], in its most basic form, provides a Question & Answer interface for students,grouped by courses. 
Each "course" is facilitated by an "Instructor" who ultimately possesses administrative rights over the individual course.


Students can create new threads by asking a Question.
Questions are automatically tagged according to their content. 
Once a question is posted, other students in the course can submit Answers. 
Each Answer is listed individually. 
Students can further discuss individual answers (or even the original question to ask clarification) 
using the comments for said question or answer. Answers can be "upvoted" by other students.
Both Questions and Answers can be flagged to notify  the Instructor that his/her attention is required.
Both Questions & Answers are capable of rich formatting.


In addition to the Q&A component of the platform, 
Instructors can post bulletins and course documents accessible to all students enrolled in the course.
Students can also privately message the Instructor with questions and concerns.


Our platform essentially takes the best features of Piazza, StackOverflow, and Reddit, 
all platforms which have been proven to work on their own, and yet which brought together,
go above and beyond a simple course discussion platform.
