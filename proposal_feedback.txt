The idea is great! The plan looks good to me. I can understand the functionalities and steps easily.

Be clear about how to data is going to be stored, retrieved, what the API looks like before actually writing the code is helpful.

Since a full implementation needs a lot of work, I suggest you start with student first, because I think the instructor part involves much stuff. Implement register/login/logout, dashboard etc. first; then the forum-like thing, then the instructor part. Get one part done and move to the next part.

Also, in terms of functionality detail, I suggest that you should not implement flagging and rich formatting right away when working on the forum. Defer it.

Overall I think your plan is great.
